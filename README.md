# Tamagotti - Virtual Pet in Python 🐣

Tamagotti is a small virtual pet game inspired by the classic **Tamagotchi**, 
the handheld digital pet created by Bandai in the 1990s.  
This project re-imagines the concept using **Python** and **Tkinter**.

If you've never heard of a Tamagotchi:  
It was a keychain-sized device with a tiny screen where you had to take care of a digital creature.  
You had to feed it, play with it, and clean up after it — otherwise it would get unhappy or even "die."  
This project is a playful homage to that idea.
